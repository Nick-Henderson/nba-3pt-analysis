# nba-3pt-analysis

Lets start with what we know anecdotally. 3-point shots have taken on a much bigger role in the NBA. Watching a game these days, it is rare to see anyone attempt a mid-range shot. Nearly all shots seem to come from either 3-point range, or right next to the hoop. At least thats the impression one would get watching the playoffs this year. Watching any sports talk show, you'll also hear about how the Warriors 3-pt heavy offense (culminating in their 2014 championship) played a major role in ushering in this new era. So, does this impression hold true in the data?
